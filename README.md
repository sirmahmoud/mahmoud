## Description
This is the first project in **Udacity** front end web development professional nanodegree program. It's a landing page with a navigation bar fixed at the top of the page. The nagvigation bar has items (links), each link anchors to a specific section. The nav bar is dynamically built and populated with items according to the sections the page has via vanilla JavaScript. 

## Features
1. Dynamically built and populated navigation bar with items that smoothly scrolls to the corresponding section.
2. The section in the view port is marked.
3. Usable across desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.
4. A scroll-to-top button appears when reaching the bottom of the page.

## Acknowledgement
This project is based on the starter code provided by Udacity. I used some help from the internet to improve and add new css styles to the project. No JavaScript code is copied from others, however I used the documentation to read more about how some functions work and how to invoke them with some options. I tried to use the funtions that I've learnt in the course, although I know there may be more direct
approaches.

## Difficulties
1. Some content was hidden behind the nav bar, so I had to add more padding to the top of the elements according to the height of the nav bar.
2. It took me some time to find the logic of how to determine if a section is in the view port because I misunderstood the requirement, it is simpler than I thought.

## Usage
Html web page ready to view on any web browser.
